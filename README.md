# Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp Capstone-2 Project 

# Proposal 1: 
Developing a model to detect pneumonia & other lung diseases  in chest X-Ray images using convolution neural network (CNN), deep learning and computer-assisted diagnostics. This model will be trained, tested and validated using NIH's 100,000 anonymized chest x-ray images belongs to 30,000 patients including many with advanced lung diseases. This data-set is available at https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/study/nida-ctn-0046.


# Proposal 2: 
Developing a model to predict United States Supreme Court rulings using court opinions, transcripts using CNNRNN, NLP, and LSTM. This model will be trained, tested and validated using United States Supreme Court opinions, and oral argument transcripts made available at: http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php, https://github.com/freelawproject, https://case.law, https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2020. 


# Proposal 3:
Developing a model to predict Medicare Part D prescribing costs in relationship to the pharmaceutical industry payments to physicians using linear regression models. This model will be trained, tested and validated using data avauilable at: https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Data/Dataset-Downloads, https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Part-D-Prescriber
