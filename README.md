# Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp Capstone-2 Project 

# Proposal 1: Developing a Model to Detect Pneumonia & Other Lung Diseases  In Chest X-Ray Images using Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Deep Learning and   
#             Computer-Assisted Diagnostics

              The NIH Clinical Center compiled and released over 100,000 anonymized chest x-ray images from more than 30,000 patients, including many with advanced               lung diseases. This dataset is available at https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/study/nida-ctn-0046.
