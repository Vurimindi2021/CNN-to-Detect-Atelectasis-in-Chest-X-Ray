# Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp Capstone-2 Project 

# Proposal 1: 
Developing a model to detect pneumonia & other lung diseases  in chest X-Ray images using convolution neural network (CNN), deep learning and computer-assisted diagnostics. This model will be trained, tested and validated using NIH's 100,000 anonymized chest x-ray images belongs to 30,000 patients including many with advanced lung diseases. This dataset is available at https://datashare.nida.nih.gov/study/nida-ctn-0046.
