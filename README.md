## Developing a model to detect pneumonia & other lung diseases  in chest X-Ray images using convolution neural network (CNN), deep learning and computer-assisted  diagnostics. This model will be trained, tested and validated using NIH's 100,000 anonymized chest x-ray images belongs to 30,000 patients including many with advanced lung diseases. The X-Ray images are available at https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC.
